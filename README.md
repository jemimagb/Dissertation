# Coding Climate Science
 The jupyter notebook contained within this repository is the creative portion for my undergraduate interdisciplinary dissertation.
 
 The aim of the project is to incorporate teaching Python alongside informing a user about their carbon footprint, the importance of it, and how to reduce it. 
 
 The notebook contains all the necessary material to introduce most of the foundational Python knowledge but if you have any questions about the notebook, accompanying datasets or anything else, please get in contact with Jemima Barnes (jemima.barnes.18@ucl.ac.uk)
