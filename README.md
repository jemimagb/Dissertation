# Coding Climate Science
 The Jupyter notebook contained within this repository is the creative portion for my undergraduate interdisciplinary dissertation.
 
 The aim of the project is to incorporate teaching Python alongside informing a user about their carbon footprint, the importance of it, and how to reduce it. In doing so, connecting a person to the computer science that is increasingly being used to inform, predict, monitor, and adapt to global warming and greenhouse gas emissions. The underpinning methodology can be found in further detail in the written portion of the dissertation itself.
 
 The notebook contains all the necessary material to introduce most of the foundational Python knowledge but if you have any questions about the notebook, accompanying datasets or anything else, please get in contact with me at jemima.barnes.18@ucl.ac.uk
